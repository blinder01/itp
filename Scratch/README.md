I made a little baseball game :)

I did this by creating 2 variables: a timer, and a hit counter. Each time you click on the baseball, it adds 1 point to the hit counter. If you click on the basketball or balloon, it reduces your score by 1. Your timer has 10 seconds before the counter runs out. I did this with a loop that reduces every one second, 10 times.

It took me a few tries to get the order of the if/then statement to work correctly. At first, I tried putting two if statements to check for the score. This simply did not work. I also didn't add in a reset for the two variables at first.

I changed the two if statements to one if/then statement. I made sure to check that the variable "hits" was equal to 10, and anything else would fail. This fixed that problem. Then I just added the reset to both variables right under the "when flag clicked", this worked great.
