**Mice Assignment**

**My process:**

I started by copying the code from your repository on how to tab and go to a new line as a reference. Then I did each operation on its own print function to check if I did it correctly. After ensuring that the 3 print functions worked correctly, I put them in one main print function, separated by commas. This worked very well!

I only ran into a couple syntax errors, but each were my own typos.
