Chapter 1
  2 things I knew
    I understand that a program is just a list of instructions that commands the computer to do specific tasks.
    I have also written a print statement before, and it was also a "hello world" command.

  2 things I didn't know
    I did not know that ** is an exponent in Python.
    I was not aware of what tokens were, or what parsing was.

Chapter 3
  2 things I knew
    I knew what modules were, from scripting in C# instead of Python. It is similar to the way you have to reference specific scripts.
    I am also aware of what a function definition is.  
  2 things I didn't know
    I did not understand what funtion calls were, and I still don't fully understand them. I can see where the name of the function is supposed to be. I think it returns whatever value is in parenthesis, and only does so with integers or floating points. Words do not seem to work.
    I did not know that there some functions don't return a value (void functions)

Chapter 5
  2 things I knew
    I knew what Boolean expressions were!
    I also knew what logical operators were, though I could not remember what each of them were.
  2 things I didn't know
    I did not know what floor division was. Coming from experience in C#, seeing the // made me think it was just a note to tell yourself what the funtions meant at first.
    I had no clue what recursion was at first, and still need a bit of a deeper explanation on it. Doing a hands on project would help as well.

Chapter 10
  2 things I knew
    I knew a nested list means there is a list within a list. It gets very complicated very quickly.
    I understand that a filter sorts through a list and picks out specific things in the list.
  2 things I didn't know
    I did not know that aliases were also a thing in coding. I use them on my desktop all the time, so it made it a bit easier to understand the concept in this case.
    I do not know what maps do entirely. Is it like a list of instructions on how to access certain things? I still don't fully get what it is.
